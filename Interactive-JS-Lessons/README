cd into backend folder. 
run the backend: node index.js
open frontend in an instance of live server.

bugs: you may need do a refresh of createLab.html after loading the server for you to load anything from the front end

keys for some test labs on the front end: {
    URL...html?labID=732689593208674
    ?labID=664981842751798
}
